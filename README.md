# DeepLearning-CNN-Brain-Stroke-Prediction-Model
This project utilizes a Deep Learning model built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict strokes from CT scans. The goal of this project is to aid in the early detection and intervention of strokes, which can lead to better patient outcomes and potentially save lives.
